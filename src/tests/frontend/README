To execute script, run the following command:
    perl run_libc_tests.pl

Test results will be logged in libc_reg_test.log.

Points to note:
--------------
- Ensure the OPUS backend is running.
- Ensure opus-setup is sourced for the current shell session.
- The script will clean and rebuild the test program suite within the glibc build dir.
- It will then execute each glibc test twice (with and without the OPUS library preloaded).
- A test will be indicated as failed, if the exit code and signal differs between the two runs.
