\section{Introduction}
Reproducibility is gaining importance in the scientific community as the quantity of data produced grows and software work-flows become increasingly complex. Over the years numerous attempts have been made in order to capture the computational and data provenance of systems.


\section{Requirements}
The requirements for the first phase of our system the following requirements apply:
\begin{itemize}
\item The system must be capable of capturing provenance in terms of the relation between files and processes.
\item The system must require minimal user intervention and setup.
\item The system must incur a minimal overhead to the users activities.
\item The system must allow the user to query the stored provenance in an approachable fashion.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Targeting linux using the current ABI
\item Targeting x86/x86\_64
\item Assume most programs use libc to make system calls
\item Assume most programs are dynamically linked
\item Assume purelibc intercepts all system calls made via libc
\end{itemize}
